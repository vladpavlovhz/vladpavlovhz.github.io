          <h2>Why ICT?</h2>
          <h3>The sphere in general</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>High demand and competitive salaries</li>
            <li>High mobility with opportunities for remote work</li>
            <li>A lot of adjacent directions allowing for lateral career movement</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Personal reasons</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I enjoy solving technical problems and seeing those solutions implemented</li>
            <li>I want to participate in projects that affect noticeable change</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why this program?</h2>
          <p>  
            I graduated from a math-focused high school almost a decade ago, after which I spent two years on a pure maths degree before dropping out. One of the reasons for this was that I could not directly see the use of what I was learning, and thus lost most of my motivation. Having worked a couple of unfulfilling jobs after that, I realized that I needed a new focus.
          </p>
          <p>  
            After doing some research, I found about HBOs in the Netherlands. My main reason for choosing this program was its project-focused nature. I have attempted to learn programming on my own by taking several courses on python and machine learning. What stymied me most, was the lack of direction on where to apply the acquired knowledge. I hope that participating in the various projects in this program, I'll be able to acquire a varied programming skillset, as well as experience in working in a team.
          </p>

          <h2>After graduation</h2>
          <p>  
            Upon completing the program, I aim to start a either start a career related to machine learning or go for a masters' in the same field. I am not yet sure of the specific focus of what I want to do, but I hope that the various projects, as well the internship, will help me narrow it down. A few companies I would be interested to work at can be found in this <a href="profession.html">blog post</a>.
