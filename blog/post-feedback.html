            </p>
            <p>
              Welcome to the program! After reading your 'Who am I' I have some feedback. You do not have to resubmit your file you can just use the feedback given in your website.
            </p>
            <p>
              You explain that you want a comprehensive education in the IT sphere. Can you elaborate what you mean and what you want to specific learn? Also how does this help you be motivated for the entire year?
            </p>
            <p>
              For after completing your study: What do you expect to see from us to help you make this choice? You want to see different projects but what type of different projects do you want see?
            </p>
            <p>
              In your SWOT-Analysis you say that your weakness is little experience working in a team and difficulty asking for help. How do you think you can work on this? And what prevents you from asking questions?
            </p>
            <p>
              Kind regards, Remco Kok"

            I think I might have been too concise when submitting the assignment, so a lot of my responses might have been too general. I elaborated on some of the questions in the 
            <a href="post-study.html">Study Choice post</a>
            , and will try to address the rest of them here.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 'comprehensive' I meant learning about the processes involved in completing a project from start to finish. This has less to do with technical coding skills, and more about project management, something I feel I currently lack.
          </p>
          <p>
            As to projects I hope to work on: the most important thing is that I want to work on projects that I will finish. Since I don't have a lot of experience with IT work, I seek to first broaden my skillset, before narrowing down my focus.
