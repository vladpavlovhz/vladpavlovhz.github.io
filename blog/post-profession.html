              Dashmote is a company that develops software for sourcing and analyzing publicly available data. The exact process depends on the goals of the clients. Although is a relatively small company at just over 60 people, it works with multiple Fortune 500 companies including Coca-Cola and Heineken.

              </sup>
              Roles in the company include Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Data analysts. The reviews about the companies culture are mixed. It is said to inspire creativity and innovation, while also lacking a proper managemnet structure.

            <p>
              I would be interested in working for Dashmote, since it's a company dealing with large clients that has to interact with all sorts of data. It might be possible to check it out closer with their internship program.

              Sobolt is a company focused on creating software solutions for sustainable cities. Their projects include apps for the analysis of a city's solar potential, residential heatloss analysis, road and roadside inspection.
              <sup>
                <a href="#source-5">[5]</a>
              </sup>
              This is achieved by training computer vision networks. Positions of interest include 'AI Software Engineer', which requires knowledge of Python as well as experience working databases and cloud systems.
              <sup>
                <a href="#source-6">[6]</a>
              </sup>
              Being a small company of under 50 people, Sobolt has a culture that promotes creativity sometimes to the detriment of a clear goal, which is common among start-ups.

              I would like to work for Sobolt, since it's a company that uses AI solutions, which are of great interest to me, for improving city sustainability, which is a cause I can easily get behind.
